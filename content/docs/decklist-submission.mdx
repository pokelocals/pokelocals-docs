To submit a decklist paste it to the textarea and submit.
Standard PTCGL decklist format is supported. You can export the decklist from PTCGL or use tools
like https://limitlesstcg.com/ or https://decklist.debkbanerji.com/

Decklist can be resubmitted. Just remove the old text in the textarea, paste new one and submit again.
